#### OpenXT PV Input

This code provides an extended version of the Xen PV Input device (xen-kbdfront)
designed to accept both relative and absolute input, and accept a few additional
data types-- including multitouch.

It is currently intended for use with the OpenXT/MobileXT projects, but it will
hopefully be readied for upstream Xen adoption in the near future, community
willing.
